# Accident_Database
The project is to analyse all road traffic accidents how to improve road safety and create a model that would predict such accidents and the injuries that they incur.

The project addressed the following:

1. The significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which accidents occur.
2. For motorbikes, the significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which accidents occur? Focus was placed on: Motorcycle 125cc and under,              Motorcycle over 125cc and up to 500cc, and Motorcycle over 500cc.
3. For pedestrians involved in accidents, are there significant hours of the day, and days of the week, on which they are more likely to be involved?
4. Used the apriori algorithm, explored the impact of selected variables on accident severity.
5. Identified accidents in regions: Kingston upon Hull, Humberside, and the East Riding of Yorkshire etc. Ran clustering on the data. Explained what the clusters reveal about the distribution of accidents in our region.
6. Used outlier detection methods, identify unusual entries in your data set. Determining if the entries in the data be used.
7. Developed a classification model using the provided data that accurately predicts fatal injuries sustained in road traffic accidents, with the aim of informing and improving road safety measures.
